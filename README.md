This AI robot is designed to automate stock trading decisions by leveraging various technical indicators and market data. Here's how it works under the hood:

Data Collection: The robot collects real-time market data to retrieve stock prices, volume, and other relevant information.

Technical Analysis: It applies technical analysis techniques such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Moving Averages (MA), Bollinger Bands, and Average True Range (ATR) to identify potential trading opportunities.

Decision Making: Based on the collected data and technical indicators, the robot makes buy, sell, or hold decisions for each stock in its watchlist. It considers factors such as price movements, volume trends, MA crossovers, and market trends (bull or bear).

Integration with OLLAMA Chatbot: The robot interacts with the OLLAMA chatbot to receive user instructions and provide trading recommendations. It communicates relevant information such as current market conditions, technical analysis results, and suggested actions.

Execution of Trades: When a decision is made to buy or sell a stock, the robot submits orders through the Alpaca API, ensuring timely execution of trades during market hours.

Monitoring and Adjustment: The robot continuously monitors market conditions and adjusts its trading strategies accordingly. It also manages risk by limiting the number of day trades and implementing stop-loss mechanisms.

Error Handling and Logging: The robot includes error handling mechanisms to deal with unexpected issues gracefully. It logs important events and errors for review and debugging purposes.

Overall, the AI robot streamlines the trading process by automating the analysis and decision-making tasks, allowing traders to focus on higher-level strategy development and portfolio management.

It is recommended to first install Anaconda3 to setup a Python 3 virtual environment. 

Just run the following commands: 

sh install.sh

For this version of Ollama to work best, 
do not install Ollama with docker or with snap. 

Install Ollama using the install download link on 
the official Ollama website:     https://ollama.com/

Run the following command for Ollama to download the llama3:8b-instruct-q4_0 GPT model: 

ollama run llama3:8b-instruct-q4_0

python3 python-brain-model-trading-robot.py


note: the raspberry pi can work with: 
tinydolphin:1.1b-v2.8-q4_0

I also noticed that if you have a slower 
desktop computer, you can give gemma a try because 
it seems to work great with slower desktop computers: 

ollama run gemma:2b-instruct-q4_0

Note: you will need to edit the python code to 
change the name of the LLM model in the python 
function named "trading_robot." 

ollama run tinydolphin:1.1b-v2.8-q4_0

Place your alpaca code keys in the location: /home/name-of-your-home-folder/.bashrc Be careful to not delete the entire .bashrc file. Just add the 4 lines to the bottom of the .bashrc text file in your home folder, then save the file. .bashrc is a hidden folder because it has the dot ( . ) in front of the name. Remember that the " # " pound character will make that line unavailable. To be helpful, I will comment out the real money account for someone to begin with an account that does not risk using real money. The URL with the word "paper" does not use real money. The other URL uses real money. Making changes here requires you to reboot your computer or logout and login to apply the changes.

The 4 lines to add to the bottom of .bashrc are:

export APCA_API_KEY_ID='zxzxzxzxzxzxzxzxzxzxz'

export APCA_API_SECRET_KEY='zxzxzxzxzxzxzxzxzxzxzxzxzxzxzxzxzxzxzxzx'

#export APCA_API_BASE_URL='https://api.alpaca.markets'

export APCA_API_BASE_URL='https://paper-api.alpaca.markets'
