It is recommended to first install Anaconda3 to setup a Python 3 virtual environment. 

Just run the following commands: 

sh install.sh

For this version of Ollama to work best, 
do not install Ollama with docker or with snap. 

Install Ollama using the install download link on 
the official Ollama website:     https://ollama.com/

Run the following command for Ollama to download the llama3:8b-instruct-q4_0 GPT model: 

ollama run llama3:8b-instruct-q4_0

python3 python-brain-model-trading-robot.py


note: the raspberry pi can work with:  
gemma:2b-instruct-q4_0

I also noticed that if you have a slower 
desktop computer, you can also give gemma a try because 
it seems to work great with slower desktop computers: 

ollama run gemma:2b-instruct-q4_0

Note: you will need to edit the python code to 
change the name of the LLM model in the python 
function named "trading_robot." 

ollama run gemma:2b-instruct-q4_0

Place your alpaca code keys in the location: /home/name-of-your-home-folder/.bashrc Be careful to not delete the entire .bashrc file. Just add the 4 lines to the bottom of the .bashrc text file in your home folder, then save the file. .bashrc is a hidden folder because it has the dot ( . ) in front of the name. Remember that the " # " pound character will make that line unavailable. To be helpful, I will comment out the real money account for someone to begin with an account that does not risk using real money. The URL with the word "paper" does not use real money. The other URL uses real money. Making changes here requires you to reboot your computer or logout and login to apply the changes.

The 4 lines to add to the bottom of .bashrc are:

export APCA_API_KEY_ID='zxzxzxzxzxzxzxzxzxzxz'

export APCA_API_SECRET_KEY='zxzxzxzxzxzxzxzxzxzxzxzxzxzxzxzxzxzxzxzx'

#export APCA_API_BASE_URL='https://api.alpaca.markets'

export APCA_API_BASE_URL='https://paper-api.alpaca.markets'
